Minesweeper
Welcome to Minesweeper, a classic single-player puzzle game where the objective is to clear a minefield without detonating any mines.

Features
Dynamic grid size: Choose the size of the grid (between 2x2 and 10x10) to customize your gameplay experience.
Adjustable mine count: Specify the number of mines to place on the grid (up to 35% of the total squares) to increase or decrease the game's difficulty.
Simple user interface: Interact with the game using intuitive commands to select squares and reveal their contents.
Win and lose conditions: Win the game by revealing all safe squares without detonating any mines, but be carefulâ€”detonating a mine results in an immediate loss.
How to Play
Start the Game

Run the application.
Follow the prompts to specify the grid size and number of mines.
The game will initialize and display the grid with hidden squares.
Reveal Squares

Enter coordinates (e.g., A1, B3) to select a square and reveal its contents.
If the selected square contains a mine, the game ends immediately.
Otherwise, the square will display the number of adjacent mines (if any) or remain blank if there are none nearby.
Win or Lose

Continue revealing squares until either all safe squares are cleared (win) or a mine is detonated (lose).
Upon winning or losing, the game will display a corresponding message and prompt you to play again.
Play Again

After completing a game, you have the option to play again by entering 'y' or exit the application by entering 'n'.
